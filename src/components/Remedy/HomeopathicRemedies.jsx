        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Case Taking:</strong> Detailed case taking is essential to
            understand the patient’s unique symptom profile, mental state, and
            physical symptoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Holistic Approach:</strong> Homeopathy treats the person as
            a whole, considering physical, emotional, and mental aspects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Potency Selection:</strong> The selection of potency (30C,
            200C, 1M, etc.) depends on the intensity and duration of symptoms,
            the patient’s vitality, and sensitivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dosage and Administration:</strong> Acute conditions may
            require frequent dosing, while chronic conditions might need less
            frequent doses but higher potencies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Regular follow-up is crucial to assess
            the response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments.
